### AssetSplitX

This dApp is meant to allow users to collectively buy an expensive item, each buyer becoming a fractional owner, proportional to the 
amount of shares the user bought. 

Each object that will be sold using the protocol will be split in 100 shares and 100 tokens will be issued. 

For each item, a campaign will start. Users can contribute with funds that will be escrowed in the contract. If the sell price is not met,
meaning the 100 shares are not entirely sold, the campaign fails and users can withdraw their funds.
